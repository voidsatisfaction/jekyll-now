** BUILD FAILED **


The following build commands failed:
       	CompileC /Users/tech-camp-064/Desktop/booldog/school_share_app-master/ios/build/Build/Intermediates/React-Native-Webview-Bridge.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/React-Native-Webview-Bridge.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/RCTWebViewBridge.o RCTWebViewBridge.m normal x86_64 objective-c com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0.compiler

```

\2. Local git 과 Git hub 연동 오류 

** user.name / email 바꿔도 안 됨. **

```
remote: Permission to voidsatisfaction/practice.git denied to nersery.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/voidsatisfaction/practice/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

\3. Jekyll github blog 와 github post 의 내용이 다른 오류

** Syntax가 분명 같을 텐데 왜 다른 결과가 나오는 걸까? 프레임워크가 잘못 된 것인가? **
